# cpplint

## Command Used

My machine cannot seem to lint multiple files at a time so I am individually linting each .cpp file in the src directory

    cpplint <file>

## Results

### src/walker.cpp
    Done processing src/walker.cpp

### include/TurtlebotWalker.h 
    Done processing include/TurtlebotWalker.h
